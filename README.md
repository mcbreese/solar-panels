Group 3 GSDP

This project is for the GSDP Module at UWE Bristol.

The system is comprised of 6 main components:

1.	A power generation module for users in Solar Panels Ltd to model potential roof installations.
2.	A battery power module for users in Solar Panels Ltd to model power and battery usage based on output from #1.
3.	A telemetry module that will model the expected telemetry constraints of the proposed system.
4.	A customer log in to view the outputs from the previous 3 to evaluate potential solutions.
5.	Graphical outputs based on the data collected from the system which will be used in the previous functions.
6.	User logins for the customer and employees.
